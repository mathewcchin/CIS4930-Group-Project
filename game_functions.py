def blit_player(player, screen):
    """
    This function deals with the rotation of the player's character along with mouse

    Ideas:
        To display the player onto the screen, we have to call screen.blit(image, rect). The image is the "surface" of the player, while the rect is the rectangle of the player. Rotation will only affect the rotated angle of player's image surface. To achieve this, we first get the position of mouse pointer using:
            pygame.mouse.get_pos()
        This will return a tuple, which is (x, y), containing x and y value of mouse's position. Then we can get the coordinate of player.rect's center:
            (player.rect.centerx, player.rect.centery)
        We have two points, which is the mouse pointer and the center of player's character's center. We can obtain the rotation angle:
            angle = math.atan2(player.rect.centery - mouse_position[1], player.rect.centerx - mouse_position[0]) * 57.29

        Pay attention the angle returned by math.atan2() is in rad, we have to convert it to degrees.

        Then we rotate player's image to reflect this change. One important thing is, we shouldn't modify the original image (stored in player's object). Here, we use another variable to hold the rotated player's image:
            player_rotated_image = pygame.transform.rotate(player.image, 180 - angle)

        Then, we blit this rotated image to the screen, rather than the original image. This is because we have to keep the original image so we can use it as a reference to calculate the rotated angle.

        Before we blit, we have to get the new rect. When the image is rotated, "the image will be padded larger to hold the new size", which means a larger rect is created that surrounds the image.
